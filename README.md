# 🥦 Vegetable Classification using CNN
A deep learning-based solution for multi-class classification of 15 vegetable types using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model was trained from scratch on a labeled dataset of vegetable images, achieving high performance and generalization on unseen data.

📁 **Dataset**
The dataset includes 15 vegetable categories:

Beans, Bitter Gourd, Bottle Gourd, Brinjal, Broccoli, Cabbage, Capsicum, Carrot, Cauliflower, Cucumber, Papaya, Potato, Pumpkin, Radish, Tomato

Each class contains multiple real-world images with varying backgrounds, lighting, and angles.

🧠 **Model Architecture**
Custom CNN with:

Convolutional Layers (ReLU)

MaxPooling Layers

Dropout Regularization

Fully Connected Dense Layers

Final Layer: Softmax for 15-class prediction

📊 **Results**

✅ Training Accuracy: **98%**

✅ Validation Accuracy: **95%**

📈 Robust against overfitting
